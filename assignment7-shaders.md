# Shader

Due March 24th before class. 

In this class we'll expore shaders. The learning goals are:
1. Expose ourselves to a new programming language (glsl) and think about its differences from JavaScript
2. Think about the differences in how GPUs and CPUs process data
3. Learn a bit about what shaders can actually do
4. Have some fun. Shaders are, like, fundamentally fun once you get going, I promise. 

Choose 1 (and only one!) of the following assignments to complete:

## Shader Live Coding

- Create a one-minute or longer animation using[ [The Force](https://shawnlawson.github.io/The_Force/) environment. Your animation can be through-composed (no interaction) by relying on the the `time` uniform, or performed via live-coding or other interaction techniques (mouse etc.). Use OBS
or similar software to make the screen recording.

- Write two paragraphs (150–200 words) that describe your aesthetic intent and what you were interested in exploring technically. I encourage you to focus on simple ideas (dots, grids, etc.), although a crescendo that peaks with total pixel chaos is always tempting... 

- Play your animation for a classmate (this can be coordinated via Discord). Write a paragraph that describes the feedback of your classmate and whether or not it matched your expectations... and of course it's totally fine if it doesn't match them (and possibly much more interesting!). Feel free to include feedback from addition classmates / other people if you like, but only one source of feedback is required.

- Create a `.glsl` file that stores your code for the performance. Given that the code will probably change over the course of the performance, we leave it at your discretion whether you want to include the code from the beginning, the end, the middle... what best reveals what you did in the performance?

- Link both your video, your code, and your text on your github repo for the class (make sure the video is hosted at a permanent location such as Vimeo or Youtube).
  
To be clear, after this your primary README for the assigngment should look something like the following:

- Assignment #1: [video](http://wpi.edu), [code](http://wpi.edu), [explanation](http://wpi.edu)

... but with correct links :) Submit a link to this repo in Canvas.

## Shaders + p5

- Take one of your previous assignments and apply post-processing effects in p5. You can use [this example](https://editor.p5js.org/charlieroberts/sketches/8hdgmiDaz) a starting point. What type of post-processing will
add visual interest to your p5 sketch?

- Write two paragraphs (150–200 words) that describe your aesthetic intent and what you were interested in exploring technically. What does your shader add? What does it take away from the p5 sketch?

- Play your animation for a classmate (this can be coordinated via Discord). Write a paragraph that describes the feedback of your classmate and whether or not it matched your expectations... and of course it's totally fine if it doesn't match them (and possibly much more interesting!). Feel free to include feedback from addition classmates / other people if you like, but only one source of feedback is required.

- Create a repo with a README including both a link to your p5 sketch (in editor.p5js.org), and your text on your github repo for the class/

- Post the repo to the assignment in Canvas.
