# Assignment 8
In this assignment, each student will present a 10-15 minute presentation on a creative
coder of their choice. The goal of this assignment is exposure to an array of artists 
that we haven't had a chance to discuss, and to encourage you to think critically about
the art and tools they create. In your presentation, you should:

1. Give a brief (~2-3 minute) bio of the artist. How did they get where they are today?
2. Provide a short summary of their artistic career through snapshots of three works 
(one minute each) from their artistic careers. Briefly show the work and describe them
from an aesthetic and technical perspective.
3. Provide a more in-depth (5-8 minutes) analysis of one or two works by the artist. Some
points of interest to potentially discuss:
a. Where / when was the work exhibited? What was the reception?
b. What tools did the artist use to create the work?
c. What was the aesthetic / conceptual goal of the work?
d. Why is the work interesting to you?

A list of artists to potentially choose from is given below, however, you are free
to choose your own (just DM me the name).
