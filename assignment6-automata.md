# Assignment 6 - Automata

In this assignment you will expore one of the most famous algorithms for creative coding, Conway's Game of Life.
The learning goals for implementing this algorithm include:

- Gain more experience comfort with 2D arrays
- Gain more experience with for loops / traversing data
- Experience the pain / joy of implementing a relatively complex algorithm

Go through the [chapter on cellular automata](https://natureofcode.com/cellular-automata/) in the Nature of Code book;
you can skip the section on "Object-Oriented Cells" if you like. Implement Conway's game of life, and come up with some
type of interesting variation. There are lots of suggestions at the end of the chapter to help you brainstorm ideas for
this variation.

To submit the assignment:
- Create a repo including your p5 sketch and a README markdown file
- In your README, place a link to the sketch running on editor.p5js.org and also include a brief paragraph or two 
describing the variation you implemented.
- Submit a link to the repo in the Canvas asssignment

If you need help implementing the original algorithm, check out [the Coding Train video on the Game of Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWSR_7kZuYg)
for extra insights.

IMPORTANT NOTE: there are *lots* of examples of the game of life in p5 floating around. Don't just copy one of these. Take the
time to read the chapter / watch the video / implement it yourself. It's very rewarding when it all finally works, I promise.
