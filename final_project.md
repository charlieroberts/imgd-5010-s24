# IMGD 5010 Final Project

The final project in this class is relatively open-ended. This is your chance to synthesize materials explored in the course, learn
more about areas of interest, and hopefully make something fun. Requirements include:

1. The project should (at minimum) touch on topics we've covered in this class: computational art, coding with p5, shaders, visual
complexity etc.
2. Homework assignments will be at a minimum for the rest of the course, so the project should reflect about five weeks of homework
time, or 50 hours.
3. You should conduct some type of evaluation of your work. We can discuss this on an individual level, but this might consist of
users exploring a software artifact or interactive essay, or users playtesting a game made in p5. 
4. A documentation markdown file in a dedicated project repo, describing inspiration, goals, what you made, and your evaluation of it.

Example final projects:
1. A web-based essay exploring the work of a pioneering creative coder (Vera Molnar etc.), where you both describe their work and create copies / works inspired
by it.
2. A game realized in p5.js, that somehow also draws upon one of the aesthetic topics covered in the class (noise, automata etc.)
3. An interactive art piece, or a series of pieces, where you explore new features of p5.js.
4. A web-based essay exploring a technical topic (JavaScript game engines?) with embedded interacive examples and/or videos.

These are just examples, I am very open to other ideas!

## Timeline
- Monday March 31st : Proposal : DM me a short description (~500 words) of what you plan to do, what challenges you forsee, and
any questions you might have.
- Monday April 7th : Lighting talks : briefly (less than three minutes) present your idea to the class for feedback
- Monday April 14th : Check-in : DM me with a brief description of progress (~250 words) and a link to your work so far.
- Monday April 24st & 28th : Evaluation : Dedicated time in class to get feedback from classmates and the instructor (note that I plan
to be on campus on the 24th)
- Monday May 5th : Final Project Presentations : In-class presentations of final projects.

Please submit your project repo / documentation to the Final Project assignment in Canvas.
